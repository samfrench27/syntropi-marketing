This directory should contain SVG logos for banks shown in the network visualization on the homepage.

## Required Logo Files

Please add the following SVG files for bank logos:

- `barclays.svg` - Barclays Bank logo
- `natwest.svg` - NatWest Bank logo
- `lloyds.svg` - Lloyds Bank logo
- `hsbc.svg` - HSBC Bank logo

## Logo Requirements

- Use SVG format for best scaling
- Ensure logos have transparent backgrounds
- Optimize SVG files for web use (remove unnecessary metadata)
- If you can't obtain official logos, use appropriate placeholders with the bank's branding colors

## Fallback Behavior

The website includes fallback behavior if logos aren't available. It will display the first letter of the bank's name on a background of the bank's branded color.

## License Information

Ensure you have appropriate rights to use bank logos in your marketing materials. This typically requires permission from the banks for commercial use.
